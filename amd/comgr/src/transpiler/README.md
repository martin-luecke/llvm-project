# Transpiler

Transpiler is COMGR's AMDGPU code-object transpiler: it raises a compiled code
object to LLVM IR, re-lowers it through the stock AMDGPU backend for a different
target ISA, and relinks the result into a single merged HSACO.

The byte-level rewrite path that previously lived here — in-place ELF/MC
patching and entry trampolines, backing `amd_comgr_hotswap_rewrite` and
`amd_comgr_hotswap_rewrite_with_options` — has been removed. Those two API
entry points remain declared and exported for binary compatibility but always
fail; see `src/comgr-hotswap-stubs.cpp`. They will be dropped in Comgr v4.0.

## Directory layout

```
transpiler/
  common/     Small shared pieces: the KernelMeta ABI model and TranspilerError.
  loader/     Code-object metadata loader: ELF + MsgPack note + kernel
              descriptor parse, supplying the .text section to the decoder.
  decoder/    Per-ISA AMDGPU MC stack and the canonical-op identity the raiser
              dispatches on.
  raiser/     The transpiler proper: raises a code object to LLVM IR and
              re-lowers it for a different target ISA.
```

All four are OBJECT libraries (`transpiler::common`, `transpiler::loader`,
`transpiler::decoder`, `transpiler::raiser`) whose translation units land directly in
`amd_comgr.so`, so they can call comgr helpers without a layering inversion.
They are built only under `COMGR_ENABLE_TRANSPILER`, which is OFF by
default: the raiser, loader, and decoder consume AMDGPU target-private headers
an install-tree-only build does not expose.

There is no public C entry point for the transpiler yet; it is reachable from
the `transpile_cli` test driver used by the `test-lit/transpiler/raiser`
suite.

## Wave projection

When translating wave32 to wave64, WaveNative places two consecutive source
waves in one target wave, one in each 32-lane half. Replication places two
copies of a single source wave in those halves.

Source scalar instructions execute regardless of source EXEC, so WaveNative
runs their generated code with every lane of each participating source wave
enabled. For source vector instructions that obey EXEC, register writes and
memory accesses remain controlled by the source wave's EXEC mask.

The hardware initializes EXEC to mark the lanes assigned to workitems by the
launch. A workgroup with 48 workitems starts with 48 active lanes in a 64-lane
target wave. The other 16 lanes can participate in internal calculations, but
do not correspond to launched workitems. We record which lanes were active at
kernel entry before enabling the whole wave and use that record to mask source
vector memory instructions that obey EXEC.

Source kernels may temporarily enable initially inactive lanes for wave-wide
calculations, such as scans with zero-filled unused lanes. This lowering
currently does not support such EXEC expansion. Every EXEC write must be
proven to enable only lanes that were active at kernel entry.

A source vector comparison can test whether each workitem's index is less than
a bound. All 64 target lanes participate in the ballot. Each lane contributes
a one only if its source EXEC bit is set and its index is below the bound;
otherwise it contributes zero. Target lanes 0-31 use the lower 32 bits of the
result, and lanes 32-63 use the upper 32 bits. This selects the result for each
source wave without disabling either half of the target wave.

Reading source lane 7 selects target lane 7 in the lower half and target lane
39 in the upper half.

WaveNative requires both source waves to agree on scalar branches and
scalar-load addresses. With `LaunchPolicy::AllowReplication`, exact workgroup
specializations of 513-1024 workitems can also support different scalar
branches and load addresses without changing geometry. Branches must
reconverge before workgroup barriers; this path excludes matrix instructions.

The two source waves share the target wave's hardware control registers, so
writes must agree. Interrupt messages and halt instructions are unsupported.

With nonzero source EXEC, WMMA uses inputs from all 32 source lanes, including
lanes whose EXEC bits are clear. The lowering requires EXEC at WMMA to match
its value at kernel entry. An all-ones restoration satisfies this requirement
only when the launch contract guarantees complete source waves.

## Replicated dispatch

For gfx1250 wave32 to gfx942 wave64, `raiseToIR` prefers WaveNative. Passing
`LaunchPolicy::AllowReplication` enables a checked fallback that runs each
source wave on a separate target wave64.
The default `PreserveGeometry` policy refuses kernels requiring replication.

Keep each kernel's `RaiseResult::LaunchRequirements` alongside its compiled
code. Before each launch, call `KernelLaunchRequirements::project` with the
kernel name, logical dimensions, actual kernarg bytes, and dynamic LDS size.
Use its returned physical dimensions. Grid and workgroup sizes are measured in
**workitems**. Preserve source kernarg bytes, including hidden geometry and
`hidden_dynamic_lds_size`; the latter must match the dynamic allocation.
Neither fixed nor dynamic LDS allocation is multiplied by replication.

Replication flattens workgroups while preserving logical workitem coordinates,
workgroup IDs, and memory effects. Launches require complete workgroups with at
most 512 logical workitems each, subject to source metadata and target limits.
`project` validates these constraints and rejects grid scaling overflow.

Multidimensional workgroups require either an exact
`KernelRequest::WorkgroupSize` specialization (or required metadata size), or
all three hidden group-size arguments matching the launch. Without either,
replication requires one-dimensional workgroups containing whole source waves.
Partial source waves additionally require known workgroup dimensions and proof
that EXEC stays within the entry mask.

Replicated kernels may read logical dispatch workgroup sizes. Other dispatch
fields, queue state, and dispatch IDs must be unused.
